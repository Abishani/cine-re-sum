# CineReSum
 Movie Review Summarization web application using finetuned PEGASUS transformer model with rotten tomatoes dataset and streamlit framework.

# How this application works
when the user enters the movie name it will get the reviews from IMDb. To get the reviews from IMDb public api has been used. Then the collected reviews will be sent to the NLP model and it will generate a abstractive summary and will display. Additionally other details such as IMDb ratings and total movie reviews will be display.
